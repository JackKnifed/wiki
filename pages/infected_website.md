Infected Website
================

Process
-------

Notice: Gather information. All of the information you can. Change nothing, delete nothing, suspend nothing. Then, once you have everything - including confirmation - start cleaning/disabling/making changes. You don't want to tip anybody off.

Warning: When restoring things, if possible, you want to use a backup from before the comprimise. You did not infect the site, so you do not know what all happened.

Notice: You're here because you have some sort of indication that a site was comprimised. Those indications are your starting points, understand them and work them over first.
